Never finished Metasequoia file loader for Irrlicht Engine. (If you want to just convert your models to Wavefront Object files, please use my CedarCoccoon file converter instead.)
Metasequoia is a 3D modeling application. ( http://www.metaseq.net/en/ )
Irrlicht Engine is a 3D application and game creation library. ( irrlicht.sourceforge.net )
Metasequoia files have the extension .mqo and tend to be popular in Japan because of their simplicity.

This file loader was aimed at the freeware version, 3.0, which can still be downloaded from the Metasequoia website, but it was only designed for Windows XP, Vista, and 7.
