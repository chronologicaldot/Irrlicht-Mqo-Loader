
==============================
Metasequoia file format:

Metasequoia files are ANSI text files containing information about a 3D model.
The file is laid out in parts / sections.
All parts/sections (except the Header) begin with a token and are followed by an opening curly bracket.
A closing curly bracket ends a section (except for "object", in which case the bracket ends only one objects's definition).

Do note that the information presented here is how the program Metasequoia SE treats the file.
Such treatment may not apply in other programs that open Metasequoia files and display their models.



Part 1: Header:
"Metasequoia Document
Format Text Ver 1.0"

Part 2: "Scene" :
This section begins with the token "Scene".
Within this are (including tabbing) the following lines:
"
	pos
	lookat
	head
	pich
	ortho
	zoom2
	amb
"
The last part of this group is a closing bracket "}".
All of these lines can be ignored when converting to object (.obj)
since they only deal with how Metasequoia should display the model.
They can also be ignored when converting back, since Metasequoia has defaults for these.


Part 3: "Material"/skin/texture
This section begins with the token "Material" followed by an integer.
The integer gives the total number of materials there are.
The integer is followed by a bracket, and on each successive line between them is texture info.
This information is given in commands, seperated by spaces:
>> "texture_name" - The texture name given in parenthesis
>> "col" - the color - followed immediately by parenthesis containing four float numbers.
These numbers are argb values, but are all set to one if an outside texture is applied to the model.
>> "dif" - how diffuse the colors are.
Following this immediately in parenthesis is a floating point value for the diffuse value.
This number ranges from 0 to 1. Default is 0.800 .
Diffuse scatters the external light over the surface.
It makes it seem like the light source is either a flashlight or the sun.
>> "amb" - the ambient. Same format as "dif", default value of 0.600 . Ranges from 0 to 1.
The ambient scatters light over the surface, otherwise the object color appears abit less lit and more uniform.
>> "emi" - the emission. Same format as "dif", default value of 0.000 . Ranges from 0 to 1.
The emission makes the object's color radiate, so as to glow without giving off light (decrease shadow effect).
>> "spc" - the specular. Same format as "dif", default value of 0. Ranges from 0 to 1.
The specular provides reflection of other light sources.
>> "power" - the power. Same format as "diff", default value of 5. Ranges from 0 to 100.
Power is the force of the color against the dominance of the light source's color on its surface.
>> optionally: "tex" - the texture/material/skin applied to the object. This can be added on.
"tex" is followed immediately by parenthesis that contain, in quotation marks, the name of a texture file.
For Metasequoia, these files can range from bitmap to jpeg to png.


IMPORTANT NOTE: Metaseqouia only supports one color for a material.
The ambient, diffuse, etc. are all shades of that color, with percent lightness determined by each one's value.


Part 4: "Object" / objects within the scene
This section begins with the token "Object".
Metasequoia allows for several sub-objects with a scene to allow for easy working.
Multiple of these "objects" can be in a single metasequoia file.
Though object files (.obj) support separate objects, grouping is unnecessary.

The word starting each Metasequoia object is "Object".
The first word after "Object" is the name of the metasequoia object, or "group".
This is only important for Metasequoia objects.
There must be at least one of these groups in a Metasequoia file to hold the model info.

Within a group are the following:
"
	visible
	locking
	shading
	facet
	color
	color_type
	vertex
	face
"
Each is followed immediately by a single number (unless otherwise specified)

"visible" is followed by a single visibility parameter, usually 15 (zero means invisible).

"locking" is only for metasequoia editing: indicating whether the object is editable.
Its default value is 0 (unlocked). (1=locked)

"shading" is unknown. Default value is 1.

"facet" appears to be a facet generation: how many faces a face appears to have from light.
Default is 59.5 , which does nothing special.

"color" is for the rgb color value of the vertices and connecting lines.
It is immediately followed by three floating point numbers single spaced apart.
The values range from 0.0 to 1.0 .

"color_type" determines whether the color for the vertices and lines is active.
1 or greater indicates that it is, otherwise the lines and vertices remain white.

"vertex" holds the vertices for the group.
It is followed by a single integer number indicating the total number of vertices.
The number is followed by an opening curly bracket.
Each successive line after the bracket line holds three floating point numbers.
Each set of floating point numbers give the location of that specific vertex.
The group is closed by a single curly bracket.

"face" holds the faces for the group.
It is followed by a single integre number indicating the total number of faces.
The number is followed by an opening bracket.
Each successive line after the bracket gives information about the face.
Each line is several parts, separated only by a single space:
>> A number indicating how many vertices form the face.
>> A capital v (V), which is immediately followed by parenthesis.
Within the parenthesis and separated by spaces are the specific vertices forming that face.
Their number is the line that they came on after the bracket in the "vertex" bracket group.
(Note that Metasequoia files start there vertices with index of 0 vs .obj having an index of 1.)
Vertices for forming faces are given in clockwise order.
(That is, if the face were a clock, a hand spinning clockwise would mark each successive vertex.)
>> optionally: a capital m (M), immediately followed by parenthesis containing a single integer.
The integer gives the line after the bracket after "Material", indicating the material to apply to the face.
>> optionally: a capital uv (UV), immediately followed by parenthesis.
Within the parenthesis are a pair of floating point numbers for every vertex in the face.


Optionally between "color_type" and "vertex" are the keywords "mirror" and "mirror_axis".
Both must come together.
"mirror" is followed by a single integer indicating the setting: 1 for separated objects, 2 for joined.
"mirror_axis" indicates which axis or multiple axis the object is to be mirrored about.
>> 1 for x alone
>> 2 for y alone
>> 3 for y and x
>> 4 for z alone
>> 5 for z and x
>> 6 for z and y
>> 7 for x, y, and z axis



At the end of the file is the line "Eof".
This is important when converting back to Metasequoia files (.mqo).
